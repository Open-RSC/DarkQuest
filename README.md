# DarkQuest

Developed in 2010, DarkQuest was a fork of the original RSCDaemon which was the first fully developed RuneScape Classic private server. DarkQuest is a direct ancestor to Open RuneScape Classic. This is from the Assembla hosted SVN repository.


The original SVN repository is still accessible via https://app.assembla.com/spaces/darkquest/ciUhrgNY4r34vOeJe5cbLA/source


Special thanks to Peeter for his dedication to the open source DarkQuest project so many years ago.


This retired project is hosted for archival purposes and is not under development.
